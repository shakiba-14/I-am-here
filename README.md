# I-am-here 
The mobile application ‘I am Here’ is an android app which is written in the Java programming language. The Android SDK tools compile the code—along with any data and resource files—into an APK: an Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.
To connect Android with phpMyadmin and mySQL, first Android app calls a PHP script in order to perform a data operation. The PHP script then connects to MySQL database to perform the operation. So the data flows from Android app to PHP script then finally is stored in MySQL database.

The “I’m Here” is a GPS-based android mobile application which helps users to validate their location based on user’s current position and other specification like date and time. Users’s information can be provided by an administrator using the app. This information will act as the bases for their login into the application account. The administrator also uses the app in order to administrate the system and keep the information accurate. The administrator, for instance, verify users’s locations and manage user information.
